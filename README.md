This repository contains the complete reproducible codebase, data preparation pipeline, machine learning models, and explainable AI analyses developed for the MSc dissertation:

“Factors Influencing Consumer Purchase Decisions in the Turkish E-Commerce Market: A Machine Learning-Based Feature Importance Analysis.”

The study models online purchase intention (OPI) as a behaviour-proximate probability of action using item-level perception data collected from Turkish online consumers and analysed through ensemble machine learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques.

Unlike traditional regression or SEM-based consumer studies, this project treats perception items as granular behavioural features and applies Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Extra Trees classifiers, interpreted with SHAP and LIME.
